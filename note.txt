adding interacivity to our navbar icon.

we will use usestate hook to check the nav state to know if the page is open or close.
then we craeted a function that will handle the navState change then we pass the onClick to the nav element using the iteration method to handle the change of state.

we also used the useEffect to work on making the nav-dark class sticky upon scroll. you wont see this till we add other sections to our page lets start with hero section.
